# This repository is an online backup of all files related to servers that I (templeofshadow) run personally.
### This is public for general readability of users (generally personal friends). Please don't contact me about whitelisting or anything; you will NOT recieve a response and all issues regarding this will initially be closed.
No, I will not post public IP addresses here. The servers are whitelisted but they are hosted on-prem.
IF YOU ARE WHITELISTED AND DON'T WANT TO BE: Either contact me via the Discord server that you should be a part of, or create an issue/PR here.
