## PSAs
1. I have experienced some issues with using EMI in ATM9. I have created an issue in the EMI repository to try and diagnose the issue. See: https://github.com/emilyploszaj/emi/issues/860. When this issue is fixed, I will either update the pack or update this changelog.
2. Distant Horizons does not currently have server-side support, however it is on the way (see https://gitlab.com/distant-horizons-team/distant-horizons/-/issues/19). When this is implemented I will update the pack.
